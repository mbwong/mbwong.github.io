I received my PhD from MIT in 2022 and my BA from Harvard University in 2012.</p><p>My research focuses on (1) the role of intermediaries in labor markets, (2) the role of monetary institutions in exchange, and (3) the role of housing in urban inequality and prosperity. My approach combines novel datasets, quasi-experimental and structural methods, and parsimonious model-making. My work contributes to organizational economics, labor economics, monetary economics, and urban economics.</p><p>I am a Fellow of the <a href=https://cccw.hku.hk/>HKU Centre on Contemporary China and the World</a>, a member of the <a href=https://relab.hku.hk/>HKU Real Estate Lab</a>, and a board member of local policy research think tank <a href=https://www.projectchange.hk/about-us/our-story/#about-cadl>Citizen Action Design</a>.

We develop repeated-game models showing why and when such intermediaries arise in frictionless markets for relational contracts. We show that monitoring intermediaries can reduce producer idleness and incentive rents by aggregating fluctuating demand and coordinating assignments. However, such intermediaries must be motivated by an incentive rent. In equilibrium, buyers sort into decentralized bilateral exchange and centralized managerial coordination. Their optimal choice depends on their demand volatility, their need for specialized services, market tightness, market size, and reputation effects. Our theory explains the observed determinants and effects of professional service outsourcing.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/Bunz.pdf target=blank>Money and Barter in the Field: Evidence from the Life and Death of a Digital Currency</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: August 2024</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(1)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_1> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_1 style=display:none>: This paper studies the rise and fall of a redeemable digital currency in a large Toronto-based barter community using comprehensive and high-frequency data on barter and monetized transactions. The observed effects of unexpected monetary experiments are compared with predictions from monetary theories. I find that a large expansion of token supply persistently increased monetized transactions and reduced token velocity without generating inflation. Moreover, neither a partial nor complete halt in redemption meaningfully changed posted token prices or token supply. They instead sharply decreased token acceptance, transactions, and velocity. Only New Monetarist models with price coordination frictions can account for this evidence.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/Bunz_slides.pdf target=blank>Slides</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/outsourcing_dynamics.pdf target=blank>Domestic Outsourcing and Employment Security</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Naijia Guo and Duoxi Li)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: July 2024</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(2)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_2> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_2 style=display:none>: Domestic outsourcing is robustly associated with reduced exit from formal employment among cleaners and security guards in Brazil during their first few years of tenure. This difference is not explained by worker characteristics or differential exposure to labor market conditions. We explain this novel fact by developing a search-theoretic model wherein intermediary firms can reassign outsourced workers across client firms when negative productivity shocks hit. The estimated model fits observed wage differentials and hazard profiles tightly. By easing reassignment across firms, domestic outsourcing had more positive welfare effects on workers upon job entry than implied by wage differentials alone.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/outsourcing.pdf target=blank>The Employment Effects of Domestic Outsourcing</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Mayara Felix)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: April 2024</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(3)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_3> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_3 style=display:none>: The rise of domestic outsourcing is documented to have reduced the wages of low-wage workers, but little is known about its effects on employment and on higher-wage occupations. This paper estimates the effects of domestic outsourcing using Brazil’s 1993 court-ordered outsourcing legalization, which sharply increased outsourcing in the large and professionalized occupation of security guards. We find that legalization led to a wave of occupational layoffs that affected 7-9% of the occupation. These layoffs temporarily reduced the employment of direct-hire incumbent guards and persistently reduced their wages, due to transitions to other occupations and lower-wage firms. By contrast, on-site outsourcing, where workers flowed to contract firms, was rare. We then estimate the effect of legalization on local labor markets, using a triple-differences design that leverages North-South variation in pre-legalization court permissiveness and compares guards to less affected occupations. We find that legalization persistently increased total guard employment by 5.2% and shifted the occupation’s demographic composition towards younger workers, while having no effect on demographic-adjusted wages. Roughly half of the employment increase was driven by workers coming from outside formality. A simple framework suggests that outsourcing legalization increased efficiency in Brazil’s security service sector, with only limited effects on worker surplus.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/TPS.pdf target=blank>Targeting Housing Assistance with Rent Notches: Evidence from a Quasi-experiment</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: March 2024</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(4)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_4> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_4 style=display:none>: This paper studies the effects of rent notches on the household composition and average incomes of Hong Kong's public housing residents. I leverage the staggered roll-out of the Tenants Purchase Scheme between 1998 and 2006, which allowed 183,700 tenants to buy permanent occupancy rights at discounted prices and thereby removed rent notches. Difference-in-difference estimates reveal that household sizes declined by 4-5 percent in the treated estates, while average households income rose by 23 percent. The average schooling of younger adults increased by one year. These results suggest that the removal of rent notches worsened the targeting of housing assistance towards low-income populations, partly due to endogenous changes in household formation.</span></p><hr><h2 id=publications>Publications</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/trust.pdf target=blank>Ideological Bias and Trust in Information Sources</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Matthew Gentzkow and Allen T.

Agents in our model learn a sequence of states from sources whose accuracy is ex ante uncertain. Agents learn these accuracies by comparing their own reasoning about the states based on introspection or direct experience to the sources' reports. Small biases in this reasoning can cause large ideological differences in the agents' trust in information sources and their beliefs about the states, and may lead agents to become overconfident in their own reasoning. Disagreements can be similar in magnitude whether agents see only ideologically aligned sources or diverse sources.</span></p><hr><h2 id=workinprogress>Work in Progress</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">The Role of Redemption in Currency Circulation: Theory and Transaction-level Evidence</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Baiyun Jing, Yang You, and Yulin Zhong)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Commodity Money: Theory and Field Evidence</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Baiyun Jing)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">The Effect(s) of Public Housing Rent Regulation on Private-sector Rents in Hong Kong</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Zhongji Wei)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Anatomy of a Housing Affordability Crisis: Hong Kong, 2006-2016</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Jimmy Ho, Yulin Hong, Lichen Zhang)</p><hr><h2 id=teaching>Teaching</h2><p><strong>Current</strong>: Instructor for HKU&rsquo;s PMGM7004 (Global Management from Economics Perspectives) and PMGM7019 (Economics of Strategy and Organization).</p><p><strong>Previous</strong>: TA for MIT&rsquo;s Intro Micro (undergrad, 2022), Intermediate Micro (undergrad, 2018-20), Applied Econ for Managers (EMBA, 2019), Org Econ (PhD, 2018), and Industrial Organization II (PhD, 2022).</p><hr><h2 id=notes>Notes</h2><p><a href=./pdf/Things_I_learned_in_Grad_School.pdf>Things I learned in Grad School (the Hard Way)</a></p><p><a href=./pdf/PhdTips.pdf>Tips for excelling as a PhD student</a></p><p><a href=./pdf/Meetings.pdf>How to have productive PhD advisor meetings</a></p><hr><h2 id=policy>Policy Writing</h2><p><a href=./pdf/Housing_Economy.pdf>Hong Kong’s economic recovery hinges on having enough adequate housing</a> (South China Morning Post, 2024-8-9)</p><p><a href=./pdf/welloff.pdf>Hong Kong must stop letting the well-off hog public rental housing</a> (South China Morning Post, 2024-5-4, with Jimmy Ho)</p><p><a href=./pdf/HKU_FOSS.pdf>Why is Hong Kong Housing So Expensive?</a> (HKU FOSS presentation, 2024-3-6)</p><p><a href=./pdf/subdividedhouses.pdf>The Solution to Hong Kong’s Subdivided Housing Crisis</a>
