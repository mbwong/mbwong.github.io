We use a triple-differences design that leverages North-South variation in pre-legalization court permissiveness and compares guards to less affected occupations. We find that outsourcing legalization persistently increased total employment of security guards in more restrictive regions by 8% and reduced their average age by two years. The average wage of security guards did not fall in more restrictive regions, with some specifications showing a small positive effect. However, there was a wave of layoffs that reallocated incumbent security guards to other occupations and lower-wage firms. A simple model implies that the market-level efficiency gains from outsourcing legalization more than offset the earnings losses of incumbent workers.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=https://twitter.com/mbwong/status/1452659761300844546 target=blank>Twitter thread</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/outsourcing_dynamics.pdf target=blank>Does Outsourcing Smooth Labor Demand?</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Duoxi Li)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: November 2022</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(1)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_1> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_1 style=display:none>: We develop and test a model of labor market dynamics with domestic outsourcing, productivity shocks, and endogenous separations. In the model, outsourcing may reduce worker rents, smooth labor demand, or both. Depending on the relative strengths of these two effects, outsourcing has different effects on worker hazard into non-employment. We use comprehensive administrative data on security guards and cleaners from Brazil to quantify the two effects. The estimates suggest that outsourcing significantly smoothed labor demand among security guards but did not significantly reduce their rents. By contrast, outsourcing had both demand-smoothing and large rent-stripping effects on the lower-wage occupation of cleaners.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/Bunz.pdf target=blank>What is Money? Evidence from Introducing Digital Currency to a Barter Community</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: February 2022</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(2)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_2> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_2 style=display:none>: I analyze how digital currency issuance by a private online platform affected the volume of trade in a large barter community in Toronto. The community initially banned cash, but subsequently introduced a digital token that could be transferred among users and redeemed at designated local stores for retail goods. Using comprehensive transactions data, I show that a large monetary expansion persistently increased transaction volume by 70% by enabling monetized trade. However, when token redemption was suddenly halted at a subset of stores, a run on the token ensued and transaction volume fell. The findings are consistent with a search-theoretic model wherein money functions as a medium of exchange.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="https://twitter.com/mbwong/status/1453385579308195842?s=20&amp;t=2KZ23wzUGzl9ViykC8gzFg" target=blank>Twitter thread</a></li><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYnDGDY33vQ" target=blank>Presentation Video (September 2022)</a></li><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/TPS.pdf target=blank>The Design of Public Housing Programs: Evidence from Hong Kong</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: May 2023</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href=javascript:toggle(3)>Abstract<span id=pubabslink_3> (click to expand)</span></a><span id=pubabs_3 style=display:none>: When designing public housing programs, governments must choose whether to rent or sell, whether to conduct regular income checks, and whether to allow transfer of sold units. This paper analyzes how the transferability and contingency of occupancy rights granted to public housing participants affect program efficiency and targeting. Specifically, I study Hong Kong’s Tenants Purchase Scheme, which converted 120,000 rental units into ownership units with transfer restrictions. Leveraging its staggered roll-out between 1998 and 2006, I show that the scheme reduced household sizes and increased incomes in treated estates, did not reduce misallocation, and likely worsened targeting of low-income households.</span></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href=./pdf/trust.pdf target=blank>Ideological Bias and Trust in Information Sources</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Matthew Gentzkow and Allen T.

Agents in our model learn a sequence of states from sources whose accuracy is ex ante uncertain. Agents learn these accuracies by comparing their own reasoning about the states based on introspection or direct experience to the sources' reports. Small biases in this reasoning can cause large ideological differences in the agents' trust in information sources and their beliefs about the states, and may lead agents to become overconfident in their own reasoning. Disagreements can be similar in magnitude whether agents see only ideologically aligned sources or diverse sources.</span></p><hr><h2 id=publications>Publications</h2><hr><h2 id=workinprogress>Work in Progress</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">The Firm as a Nexus of Relational Contracts</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Duoxi Li)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Means of Payment vs. Media of Exchange</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Baiyun Jing)</p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Digital Money Adoption and Redemption Convenience</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Baiyun Jing, Yang You, and Yulin Zhong)</p><hr><h2 id=teaching>Teaching</h2><p><strong>Current</strong>: Instructor for HKU&rsquo;s PMGM7004 (Global Management from Economics Perspectives) and PMGM7019 (Economics of Strategy and Organization).</p><p><strong>Previous</strong>: TA for MIT&rsquo;s Intro Micro (undergrad, 2022), Intermediate Micro (undergrad, 2018-20), Applied Econ for Managers (EMBA, 2019), Org Econ (PhD, 2018), and Industrial Organization II (PhD, 2022).</p><hr><h2 id=other>Notes</h2><p><a href=./pdf/Things_I_learned_in_Grad_School.pdf>Things I learned in Grad School (the Hard Way)</a></p><hr><h2 id=other>Other Writing</h2><p><a href=./pdf/Housing_Crisis.pdf>What Caused Hong Kong&rsquo;s Housing Crisis?</a>
