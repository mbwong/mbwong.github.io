I am an assistant professor in economics, management and strategy at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). My research has focused on three areas: (1) the boundary of the firm, (2) money and barter, and (3) public housing. Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@hku.hk](mailto:mbwong@hku.hk) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong). 

If you're a student interested looking for RA opportunities, I will be hiring. Email me if interested!
