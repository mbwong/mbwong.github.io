I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I am interested in the structure of labor, money, and housing markets. I use natural experiments to identify causal effects and the lens of search, assignment, and relational contracting models to understand mechanisms. 

In ongoing projects, I analyze how the rise of outsourcing has altered labor market structure and develop a theory of the firm as a nexus of relational contracts. I study the impact of public housing policy and rent control. I investigate the introduction of digital money to a real-world barter economy. 

Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@hku.hk](mailto:mbwong@hku.hk) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong). If you're a research-track student at HKU interested in economics, I'm occasionally looking for RAs. Feel free to email me!
