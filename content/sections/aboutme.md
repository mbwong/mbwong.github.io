I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I received my BA from Harvard University in 2012 and my PhD from MIT in 2022. 

I am an applied microeconomist. I study labor, organizational, monetary, and housing economics. My research aims to understand the microstructure of marketplaces and organizations using transparent data analysis, simple models, and attention to institutional detail.
