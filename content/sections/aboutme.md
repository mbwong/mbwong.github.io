I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I received my BA from Harvard University in 2012 and my PhD from MIT in 2022. 

I am an applied microeconomist. My interest includes labor economics, organizational economics, housing, and money and barter. I enjoy transparent data analysis, simple models, and institutional detail. 

Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@hku.hk](mailto:mbwong@hku.hk) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong). I am hiring a pre-doctoral research assistant. Feel free to email me!
