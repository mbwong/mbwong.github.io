I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I received my BA from Harvard University in 2012 and my PhD from MIT in 2022. 

My research focuses on (1) the role of intermediaries in labor markets, (2) the role of monetary institutions in exchange, and (3) the role of housing in inequality and economic efficiency. My approach combines novel datasets, quasi-experimental and structural methods, parsimonious model-making, and attention to institutional detail. 

My work contributes to organizational economics, labor economics, monetary economics, and urban economics. Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__.
