I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I received my BA from Harvard University in 2012 and my PhD from MIT in 2022. 

I am interested in (1) the role of intermediaries and regulations in labor markets, (2) the role of money and monetary institutions in exchange, and (3) the role of housing policy and homeownership in inequality and economic efficiency. My approach combines novel datasets, quasi-experimental and structural methods, parsimonious model-making, and careful attention to institutional detail.

Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@hku.hk](mailto:mbwong@hku.hk) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong). I am hiring a pre-doctoral research assistant. Feel free to email me!
