I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I received my BA from Harvard University in 2012 and my PhD from MIT in 2022. 

I am an applied microeconomist. My research aims to understand the microstructure of markets using transparent data analysis, simple models, and attention to institutional detail. My interest includes labor economics, organizational economics, money and barter, and housing.
