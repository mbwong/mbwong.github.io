I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). My research covers topics such as labor market structure, boundary of the firm, money and barter, and housing. Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@hku.hk](mailto:mbwong@hku.hk) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong). 

If you're a student at HKU interested in monetary, organizational, labor, macro, or applied theory, I'm occasionally looking for RAs and happy to work with PhD students. Feel free to email me!
