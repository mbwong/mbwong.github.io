I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I study the structure of labor, money, and housing markets. My approach uses natural experiments to identify causal effects and the lens of search, assignment, and relational contracting models to understand mechanisms. 

In ongoing projects, I analyze how the rise of outsourcing has altered labor market structure, develop a new theory of the firm as a nexus of relational contracts, study the impact of public housing policy and rent control on residential sorting and affordability, and test models of money using empirical data on the introduction of digital money to a real-world barter economy. 

Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@hku.hk](mailto:mbwong@hku.hk) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong). 

If you're a research-track student at HKU interested in economics, I'm occasionally looking for RAs. Feel free to email me!
