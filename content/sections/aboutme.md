I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I received my BA from Harvard University in 2012 and my PhD from MIT in 2022. 

My research covers topics including labor service outsourcing, theory of the firm, money and barter, public housing and rent control, and the Hong Kong economy. My work combines theory and micro-evidence to illuminate how institutions affect economic efficiency and distribution. I use a broad array of methodological tools, including quasi-experimental methods, parsimonious model-making, and close attention to institutional detail. 

Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@hku.hk](mailto:mbwong@hku.hk) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong). If you're a research-track student at HKU interested in economics, I'm occasionally looking for RAs. Feel free to email me!
