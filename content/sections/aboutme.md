I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I study labor, money, and housing. My approach combines the use of natural experiments to identify causal effects with the lens of search, assignment, and relational contracting models to understand market structure. 

Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@hku.hk](mailto:mbwong@hku.hk) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong). If you're a research-track student at HKU interested in economics, I'm occasionally looking for RAs. Feel free to email me!
