I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I received my BA from Harvard University in 2012 and my PhD from MIT in 2022. 

I am a labor economist and organizational economist with broad interests. My current projects covers topics including labor service outsourcing, theory of the firm, affordable housing, and money and barter. Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__.

If you're a research-track student at HKU interested in economics, I'm occasionally looking for RAs. Feel free to email me!
