I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). I received my BA from Harvard University in 2012 and my PhD from MIT in 2022. 

My research covers topics including labor service outsourcing, theory of the firm, money and barter, public housing, and rent control. My methodology combines theory and micro-evidence to illuminate how economic organization shape efficiency and distribution in decentralized markets. 

Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@hku.hk](mailto:mbwong@hku.hk) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong). If you're a research-track student at HKU interested in economics, I'm occasionally looking for RAs. Feel free to email me!
