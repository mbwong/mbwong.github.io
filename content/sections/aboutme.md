I am an assistant professor in management and strategy with a joint appointment in economics at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/). My aspiration as a scholar is to bridge the gap between theory and evidence in the economic analysis of labor market structure, theory of the firm, money and barter, and housing. Here is my __[CV](/pdf/CV.pdf)__. You can reach me at [mbwong@hku.hk](mailto:mbwong@hku.hk) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbwong). 

If you're a research-track student at HKU interested in economics, I'm occasionally looking for RAs. Feel free to email me!
