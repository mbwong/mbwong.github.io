       Intermediaries that monitor performance and direct allocations pervade economic exchange. We develop repeated-game models showing why and when such intermediaries arise in frictionless markets for relational contracts. We show that monitoring intermediaries can reduce producer idleness and incentive rents by aggregating fluctuating demand and coordinating assignments. However, intermediaries must be motivated by an incentive rent. In equilibrium, buyers sort into decentralized bilateral exchange and centralized managerial coordination. Their optimal choice depends on their demand volatility, their need for specialized services, market tightness, market size, and reputation effects. Managerial coordination increases output and specialization but reduces the welfare of incumbent producers.

      This paper studies the rise and fall of a redeemable digital currency using unique high-frequency data on barter and monetized transactions from a mobile app platform in Toronto. The observed effects of unexpected monetary experiments are compared with predictions from canonical models in monetary economics. I find that a large expansion of token supply persistently increased monetized transactions and reduced token velocity without generating inflation. In addition, subsequent reductions in redeemability did not meaningfully change token prices or supply, but instead significantly decreased token acceptance, transactions, and velocity. Only models that feature both search and price adjustment frictions can account for this evidence.

       Domestic outsourcing is robustly associated with reduced exit from formal employment among cleaners and security guards in Brazil during their first few years of tenure. This difference is not explained by worker characteristics or differential exposure to labor market conditions. We explain this novel fact by developing a search-theoretic model wherein intermediary firms can reassign outsourced workers across client firms when negative productivity shocks hit. The estimated model fits observed wage differentials and hazard profiles tightly. By easing reassignment across firms, domestic outsourcing had more positive welfare effects on workers upon job entry than implied by wage differentials alone.

       The rise of domestic outsourcing is documented to have reduced the wages of low-wage workers, but little is known about its effects on employment and on higher-wage occupations. This paper estimates the effects of domestic outsourcing using Brazil’s 1993 court-ordered outsourcing legalization, which sharply increased outsourcing in the large and professionalized occupation of security guards. We find that legalization led to a wave of occupational layoffs that affected 7-9% of the occupation. These layoffs temporarily reduced the employment of direct-hire incumbent guards and persistently reduced their wages, due to transitions to other occupations and lower-wage firms. By contrast, on-site outsourcing, where workers flowed to contract firms, was rare. We then estimate the effect of legalization on local labor markets, using a triple-differences design that leverages North-South variation in pre-legalization court permissiveness and compares guards to less affected occupations. We find that legalization persistently increased total guard employment by 5.2% and shifted the occupation’s demographic composition towards younger workers, while having no effect on demographic-adjusted wages. Roughly half of the employment increase was driven by workers coming from outside formality. A simple framework suggests that outsourcing legalization increased efficiency in Brazil’s security service sector, with only limited effects on worker surplus.


- title: "Targeting Housing Assistance with Rent Notches: Evidence from a Quasi-experiment"

       This paper studies the effects of rent notches on the household composition and average incomes of Hong Kong's public housing residents. I leverage the staggered roll-out of the Tenants Purchase Scheme between 1998 and 2006, which allowed 183,700 tenants to buy permanent occupancy rights at discounted prices and thereby removed rent notches. Difference-in-difference estimates reveal that household sizes declined by 4-5 percent in the treated estates, while average households income rose by 23 percent. The average schooling of younger adults increased by one year. These results suggest that the removal of rent notches worsened the targeting of housing assistance towards low-income populations, partly due to endogenous changes in household formation.
