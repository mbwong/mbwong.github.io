  abstract: >
       Many transaction costs deemed important in the theory of the firm are not necessary for the existence of centralized intermediaries that direct exchange. We develop a repeated-game model of an economy in which buyers may frictionlessly enter relational contracts with either producers or intermediaries. We show that centralized intermediaries emerge to allocate producers when buyers have short-lived demand and can only observe the performance of producers who provide services directly to them. In this environment, the presence of intermediaries who monitor and reassign producers across buyers strengthens the producersâ€™ incentives to perform. We derive realistic predictions regarding the existence and boundaries of firms. We discuss applications to professional service firms, supply chains, franchises, online platforms, schools, and hospitals.

       We estimate the effect of domestic outsourcing on labor markets using Brazil's 1993 legalization, which sharply increased the outsourcing of security guards. We use a triple-differences design that leverages North-South variation in pre-legalization court permissiveness and compares guards to less affected occupations. We find that outsourcing legalization persistently increased total employment of security guards in more restrictive regions by 8% and reduced their average age by two years. The average wage of security guards did not fall in more restrictive regions, with some specifications showing a small positive effect. However, there was a wave of layoffs that reallocated incumbent security guards to other occupations and lower-wage firms. A simple model implies that the market-level efficiency gains from outsourcing legalization more than offset the earnings losses of incumbent workers.

- title: "Does Outsourcing Smooth Labor Demand?"

       We develop and test a model of labor market dynamics with domestic outsourcing, productivity shocks, and endogenous separations. In the model, outsourcing may reduce worker rents, smooth labor demand, or both. Depending on the relative strengths of these two effects, outsourcing has different effects on worker hazard into non-employment. We use comprehensive administrative data on security guards and cleaners from Brazil to quantify the two effects. The estimates suggest that outsourcing significantly smoothed labor demand among security guards but did not significantly reduce their rents. By contrast, outsourcing had both demand-smoothing and large rent-stripping effects on the lower-wage occupation of cleaners.

      This paper documents the rise and fall of a redeemable digital currency in a Toronto-based barter community using unique high-frequency transaction data. The observed effects of unexpected monetary events are compared with predictions from models in monetary economics. I find that a large expansion of token supply persistently increased monetized transactions without generating inflation. A subsequent reduction in redeemability did not reduce token prices or supply, but it decreased token acceptance and transactions. When redemption was fully halted, token prices still did not change and barter volume was largely unaffected, but token acceptance declined and monetized exchange dwindled. These findings are consistent only with models of money as a medium of exchange with price coordination frictions. 


- title: "Targeting Housing Assistance with Rent Notches: Evidence from a Quasi-experiment"
  pdflink: "/pdf/TPS.pdf"
  note: "Last Updated: March 2024"
  abstract: >
       This paper studies the effects of rent notches on the household composition and average incomes of Hong Kong's public housing residents. I leverage the staggered roll-out of the Tenants Purchase Scheme between 1998 and 2006, which allowed 183,700 tenants to buy permanent occupancy rights at discounted prices and thereby removed rent notches. Difference-in-difference estimates reveal that household sizes declined by 4-5 percent in the treated estates, while average households income rose by 23 percent. The average schooling of younger adults increased by one year. These results suggest that the removal of rent notches worsened the targeting of housing assistance towards low-income populations, partly due to endogenous changes in household formation.

       We study the role of endogenous trust in amplifying ideological bias. Agents in our model learn a sequence of states from sources whose accuracy is ex ante uncertain. Agents learn these accuracies by comparing their own reasoning about the states based on introspection or direct experience to the sources' reports. Small biases in this reasoning can cause large ideological differences in the agents' trust in information sources and their beliefs about the states, and may lead agents to become overconfident in their own reasoning. Disagreements can be similar in magnitude whether agents see only ideologically aligned sources or diverse sources.
