  abstract: >
       The modern economy is riddled with intermediaries that monitor performance and coordinate allocations. We develop repeated-game models showing when and why the visible hand of intermediaries efficiently replaces the invisible hand of competitive markets in determining allocations. We show that when trust is lacking and demand fluctuates, intermediaries can redress market misallocation by entering relational contracts on both sides of the market and coordinating assignments. However, such intermediaries require an incentive rent. In equilibrium, buyers sort into decentralized bilateral exchange and centralized managerial coordination. Our theory explains the observed determinants and effects of professional service outsourcing.

      This paper tests the predictions of New Monetarist models of money using three unexpected monetary events and unique transaction-level data from a large Toronto-based barter community that introduced a redeemable digital currency. I find that monetary expansion did not alter token prices, but it increased monetized transactions and did not affect barter transactions. Subsequent partial and complete halts in redemption also did not alter token prices, but they reduced token acceptance and transactions. The findings confirm that money overcomes the inefficiencies of barter. However, they reject a large class of theories that assume universal acceptance of non-redeemable fiat money.

       This paper estimates the wage, employment, and reallocation effects of non-core activity outsourcing using Brazilâ€™s unexpected 1993 court-ordered outsourcing legalization. We leverage North-South variation in pre-legalization court permissiveness and compare security guards to less affected occupations. We find that older incumbent security guards were adversely impacted through occupational layoffs, loss of firm-level wage premia, and exit from the occupation. At the same time, increased numbers of younger workers entered the formal sector and became employed at contract firms. On net, legalization increased guard employment by 5%, led by a 50% increase in employment for guards aged 18-24, and had no effect on demographically-adjusted guard wages. The observed labor reallocation effects are explained by the fact that contract firms persistently employ demographically different workers than direct employers.

       Domestic outsourcing is robustly associated with reduced exit from formal employment among cleaners and security guards in Brazil during their first few years of tenure. This difference is not explained by worker characteristics or differential exposure to labor market conditions. We explain this novel fact by developing a search-theoretic model wherein intermediary firms can reassign outsourced workers across client firms when negative productivity shocks hit. The estimated model fits observed wage differentials and hazard profiles tightly. By easing reassignment across firms, domestic outsourcing had more positive welfare effects on workers upon job entry than implied by wage differentials alone. 
       
       
- title: "Targeting Housing Assistance with Rent Notches: Evidence from a Quasi-experiment"

       This paper studies the effects of rent notches on the household composition and average incomes of Hong Kong's public housing residents. I leverage the staggered roll-out of the Tenants Purchase Scheme between 1998 and 2006, which allowed 183,700 tenants to buy permanent occupancy rights at discounted prices and thereby removed rent notches. Difference-in-difference estimates reveal that household sizes declined by 4-5 percent in the treated estates, while average households income rose by 23 percent. The average schooling of younger adults increased by one year. These results suggest that the removal of rent notches worsened the targeting of housing assistance towards low-income populations, partly due to endogenous changes in household formation.
